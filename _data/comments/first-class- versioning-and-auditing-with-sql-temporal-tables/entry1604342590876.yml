message: "Welcome to my blog ! I’m Leticia Figueroa. \r\nEven though I jokingly credit my  aunt for my writing talent, I know that it is a skill  I have fostered from childhood. Though my  aunt is a writer, I also started out young. \r\nI’ve always had a way with words, according to my favorite  educator. I was always so excited in  English when we had to do a research  assignment . \r\nNow, I help current  pupils achieve the grades that have always come easily to me. It is my way of giving back to  students because I understand the troubles they must overcome to graduate. \r\n \r\nLeticia –  Academic Writing Professional  – <a href=https://hotcitytheatre.org/>hotcitytheatre.org</a> Corp"
